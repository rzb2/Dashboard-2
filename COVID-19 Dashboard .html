        <div class="summary">
            <p>This graph illustrates the comparison of COVID-19 cases between Sweden and the UK from 2020 to 2022.</p>

            <h3>Graph 1: Sweden's COVID-19 Cases (2020-2022)</h3>
            <p> The daily reported COVID-19 cases in Sweden from 2020 to 2022 are shown in this graph. The dates are shown on the x-axis, while the number of reported cases per day is shown on the y-axis. The trend of COVID-19 cases in Sweden over time is shown by the blue line. The information shows the ups and downs in the virus's national spread over the given time period. </p>

            <h3>Graph 2: UK COVID-19 Cases (2020-2022)</h3>
            <p> Here we look at the daily reported COVID-19 cases in the UK from 2020 to 2022. Like in the preceding graph, the number of daily reported instances is represented by a rolling average on the y-axis, and the dates are depicted on the x-axis. The trend of COVID-19 cases in the UK throughout the given time period is depicted by the red line. One can gain insight into the different paths taken by the pandemic response in Sweden and this country by comparing the two trends. </p>

            <p> The normalised test positive rates per capita for Sweden and the UK between 2020 and 2022 are contrasted in this bar graph. The y-axis displays the normalised test positivity rate expressed in terms of per capita, while the x-axis lists the nations that are being compared. </p>
            <p> The bars' heights graphically represent the disparity in the two nations' normalised test positive rates. Furthermore, for clarity, the precise values of the normalised rates are marked above each bar.</p>
            <p> This visualisation aids in understanding the relative scale of test positivity rates between Sweden and the UK, providing insights into the prevalence of COVID-19 cases relative to the population size in each country during the specified period.</p>

            <h3>Daily hospital occupancy rate per capita between Sweden and the UK (2020 to 2022): </h3>
            <p> The daily hospital occupancy rate per capita for the years 2020-2022 in Sweden and the UK is contrasted in this line graph. The years are shown by the x-axis, while the hospital occupancy rate per capita is shown by the y-axis. </p>
            <h3> United Kingdom (UK):</h3>
            <p>Over the given period, the hospital occupancy rate per capita is represented by the red line. The entire daily hospital occupancy is divided by the expected UK population for each year to arrive at the occupancy rate per capita.</p>
            
            <h3>Sweden: </h3> 
            <p>The hospital occupancy rate per capita for the same time period is displayed by the blue line, which stands for Sweden. Like the UK, Sweden's occupancy rate per capita is determined by dividing the country's annual predicted population by the total daily hospital occupancy.</p>
            <h4> This graph makes it possible to compare the hospital occupancy rates per capita in Sweden and the UK, giving insight into how each country's healthcare systems are being burdened in relation to its population size during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022.  </h4>

            <p> The average daily new deaths per capita for Sweden and the UK are shown in this bar chart for the years 2020–2022. The y-axis shows the average daily new deaths per capita, and the x-axis shows the countries under comparison.</p>
            <p> Sweden: Over the given period, the average daily new deaths per capita are displayed in the blue bar, which represents Sweden. The total number of daily confirmed deaths from COVID-19 divided by Sweden's projected population yields the average daily new deaths per capita. </p>
            <p> United Kingdom (UK): The average daily new deaths per capita for the same period are displayed in the red bar, which stands for the UK. Like Sweden, the UK's average daily new deaths per capita are determined by dividing the total number of daily new COVID-19 confirmed deaths by the country's estimated population.</p>


            <h3> Daily New Deaths per Capita (2020 - 2022) - Line graph:</h3>
            <p> The daily new deaths per capita for Sweden and the UK from 2020 to 2022 are shown in this line graph. The dates are plotted on the x-axis, while the daily new deaths per capita are plotted on the y-axis.</p>
            <p> Sweden: The daily new deaths per capita throughout time are represented by the blue line. For a given date, each point on the line shows the daily new COVID-19-related confirmed deaths per capita. </p>
            <p> United Kingdom (UK): Over the same time period, the daily new deaths per capita are displayed by the red line, which represents the UK. Like in Sweden, each point on the graph indicates the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths every day for a certain date. </p>
            <h4>By comparing the average daily new deaths per capita and the daily new deaths per capita trends between Sweden and the UK, these visualisations provide an analysis of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mortality rates in each nation. Both a bar chart and line graph are presented for two forms of visualisation. </h4>
